# EAR

EAR is an R package for estimating (E)ndemic species-(A)rea (R)elation and constructing EAR curve through rarefaction and extrapolation techniques. The key reason that extrapolation is needed here is because ecologists only sample a porportion of the total background region (e.g., an island or an ecosystem) and use this kind of locally sampled biodiversity data to estimate the number of endemic species in a targeted/unsampled area. Because of limited sampling, unseen species are needed to estimate. 



Details on the estimation methods have been described in the following paper:
